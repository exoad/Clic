# Security

This app only features minor features to help lessen CPU usage and to not spam the client's machine (code optimization).

### Current Supported Versions with patches of possible spam loops

Spam loops are code issues where certain actions can corrupt the actions of the program leading to infinite loops or unnecessary errors/exceptions.

| Version | Support Level |
| --- | --- | 
| 1.0z | No Support |
| Pre-1.1z | No Support |

### Caching

Caching will be mainly introduced for the process of storing and retrieving data in order to reduce the load on the machine when the values of certain variables are larger than the standard `int` cap.

| Version | Suppport (y/n) |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0z | n |
| Pre-1.1z | n |


___

**New updates will most likely introduce more ways to handle exceptions and introduce better optimization**
