# Clic

Clic is WIP (Work in Progress) little Clicker Game I made.

It's main framework is based on a project I made for a class at GNSHS 2020-2021 (Check out branch [original](https://github.com/exoad/Clic/tree/original)).

It currently doesn't have many features and this is what the `master` branch is for. For me to make the previous/original program much better and have a much better format so it wouldn't be lame to use/play.

## How to run
1. Go to the release section on the sidebar
2. Select the latest **FULL** Release (.exp or .z releases are all pre-releases or experimental and should not be used unless for debugging)
3. Make sure you are running the latest version of Java supported by the version you are downloading
4. Then download the appropriate executable file for your OS (mainly just download the Universal .JAR)
5. Save the Jar file
6. Click on the Jar File or run with the commands: `cd <file path>` then `java -jar <filename>.jar`
- If you encounter any errors or issues post them in the Issues tab!
7. The program should be launched.
